# Java-Queue-Linked-List
Implementation of a Queue using a Linked List in Java

This was a project for a Data Structures course.

Assignment:

"Implement a queue using a linked list. 
 Your implementation must include the key methods in the queue; refer to the slides for the methods.
 
 Requirements:
 1. Demonstrate the implementation by building a queue with 20 elements; your program should print 
    the building process and the content of the final queue.
 2. Demonstrate the methods in the queue by printing out the content of the queue after every 
    operation of the method.
 3. Build a queue with at least 10,000 elements, and measure the time of the building process."
